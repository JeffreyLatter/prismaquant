"""Unit tests for the dense-path stratified expert cost subsample.

``_expert_cost_sample_split`` picks a deterministic, evenly spaced sample of
expert ids per (experts-prefix, projection) group; ``_extrapolate_expert_costs``
fills the skipped experts' cost rows with their group's sampled mean so every
expert keeps a cost row (the allocator drops row-less names entirely, which
would silently shrink the DP's bit/disk accounting and serving-unit
membership).
